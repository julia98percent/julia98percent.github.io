As hosts are unable to harm guests, guests often live out their darkest desires, including violent and sexual ones.</p>\n<p>Hosts are artificially manufactured and don't exhibit some normal human reactions, for example, don't react to flies crawling over their faces. They can be put to hibernation or to other special states by code phrases said by park operators.</p>\n<p>Dolores says goodbye to her father Peter and travels into Sweetwater for supplies where she meets Teddy. They rekindle their old flame, and she invites him back to her farm, but when they arrive they hear shooting inside the house. They find Peter beaten by two bandits, Walter and Rebus, bragging about raping and killing his wife. Teddy shoots and kills the bandits but finds he cannot kill a third approaching figure from elsewhere, the Man in Black. The Man in Black reveals he is a guest, kills Teddy, and then drags Dolores off, upset she does not recognize him after thirty years of visits.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"id":"243ac29e-7a43-5922-940c-3c9b1a65f846","parent__name":"how-to-drink-water-well","__params":{"parent__name":"how-to-drink-water-well"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
